\lettrine{T}his paragraph has a pretty plain initial or drop cap.
It uses the default document font.
You didn’t really expect more detail with such a generic font choice, right?
This may be exactly what you want, especially with modern typesetting styles which tend towards the minimalist.

\lettrine[lhang=.4]{“N}{ever say never,}” the saying goes.
Someday your dropcap may include leading punctuation {and} a hanging indent.
No worries.
All you have to do is guess and fudge.
